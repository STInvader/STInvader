Hi. I'm ST_Invader. I've been programming for ~**6 years** till now. I've coded in Python, C++, Kotlin, Javascript, and now I'm currently learning Solidity.

I had been programming for a while. But I think I really like Solidity and web3 as a whole. Much more than normal Python. 
My major goal is to become an auditor.

So, if you need me, I'll be screaming at my screen till I find some bugs.
