## Hi, I'm ST_Invader 👋  

I've been programming for ~6 years, working with **Python, C++, Kotlin, JavaScript**, and lately, I've been diving into **Solidity**.  

I have coded in many languages, but I find **web3 and Solidity** way more exciting than regular Python. My current goal is to be one of the best **Smart Contract Auditors**.
